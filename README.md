# vm-launcher 

This is a python package tying together Apache libcloud and fabric. It is used
by the deploy code John Chilton added to [CloudBioLinux][CloudBioLinux], but nothing in it is
CloudBioLinux specific and it is meant to be able to be used by other packages
if useful. An example project demonstrating some of the transfer code can be
found [here][1], which was created from the example skeleton project found [here][2]
