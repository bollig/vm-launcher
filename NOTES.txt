It is impossible to stash genome indices in /mnt if we package an
instance-store image that is bundled and stashed in s3. See
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ec2ubuntu/6CZEstXQT4U for details.

A better option is to snapshot and register and EBS image which has the indices
built into the snapshot image. This will be faster to boot, can be larger than
10G, and will remove the need to scp all indices at boot. Also, this is
consistent with our current openstack installation which does not provide
volume snapshotting or instance-store images. Everything on openstack is the
equivalent to EBS. The Dell Compellent driver does not allow snapshotting
volumes, so the data (~10G) has to be built into the image.
